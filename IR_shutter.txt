IR shutter/filter operation (the thing that makes the CLICK sound)
This is different from the IR LEDs, the LEDs are automaticly controlled by a photoresistor

from https://github.com/Nemobi/Anyka.git get the demo executables (/bin) and the libraries
load libraries with (wherever you put them):
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/anyka_hack/oldcam/lib:/mnt/anyka_hack/oldcam/usr/lib
use the IR shutter:
./ak_drv_ir_demo -s 1
or 0
